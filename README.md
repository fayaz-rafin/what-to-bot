# What to Bot
What to cook is a recipe generator that gives the user a random recipe for whatever meal they want to have.

## Inspiration
During RU Hacks, we were having a hard time deciding what to code for the hackathon as there were many ideas circulating through our minds. In one of our brainstorm sessions, we wondered, what if there was a bot that could tell us what to code, or even what to cook food or give movie recommendations. That's why we created a discord bot that would recommend us things to do when we're in doubt.

## What it does
What to Bot basically recommends the user what they could do by randomly generating suggestions from what to cook, where to go, what to watch and what to listen. 

## How we built it
We used python as our main programming language and used JavaScript for the json files. We also used the discord.py library to code our discord bot. We also used frameworks like domain.com for the domain name and Google Cloud for hosting the discord bot. We created a website so that users can add our bot to their server.

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into a lot of challenges. Our biggest challenge was using an API to send and get requests. It was our first time using API's so we couldn't get that part figured out. We solved it by making json files that contained our data and we managed to send the user what they wanted from the randomly generated data from every category.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
This was our first discord bot together and we're so proud we were able to host it on Google Cloud without facing any issues.

## What we learned
We learned python and how to read/write json files.

## What's next for What to Bot
In the future, we will implement a feature where a user cannot just ask for recommendations but also add their own suggestions to our json files so our existing data increases and we can get more recommendations.
